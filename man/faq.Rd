\details{
\code{faq} is a simple function containing a dictionary of common FAQ entries.
It returns a Bootstrap Collapse menu FAQ format by default. Changing to \code{format="list"}
alternatively returns a list of question and answer pairs, each being a length-2 sublist.
In this case, each question is a character string and each answer is either a simple HTML paragraph
or a taglist of multiple HTML components if the answer contains more complex content (e.g., images and links).

A key difference with the \code{open} argument that can be passed in a list to \code{bscollapse.args}
is that it must simply match a single \emph{dictionary entry} \code{id}, not a collapse panel question title or id (e.g., \code{open="apps"}).

The current FAQ dictionary IDs and the questions they refer to include:
\describe{
  \item{distributions}{Why use probability distributions?}
  \item{gcm}{What is a GCM?}
  \item{rcp}{What is an RCP?}
  \item{fmz}{What are fire management zones?}
  \item{apps}{How did you make this app? Are other apps available?}
  \item{alfresco_simulations}{What do "simulations" refer to in the data selection area?}
  \item{factsheet_about}{What are fact sheets?}
  \item{factsheet_availability}{Why are fact shees not always available?}
  \item{climdist_variables}{What do the available distributions represent?}
