`apputils` is an R package containing common utility functions, settings and references for development use across multiple Shiny apps,
It has a `shinydashboard` focus. `apputils` is a satellite member of the SNAPverse collection of R packages.
It supports other satellites in the verse, including `maputils` and `snaputils`.

## Custom image icons for value boxes

The quickest way to see all available custom icons in `apputils` is to launch the `icons` demo app.

```{r pkg, echo=FALSE}
library(apputils)
```

```{r icons, eval=FALSE}
library(apputils)
exApp("icons")
```

Use `exApp("icons", local_mode = "showcase")` to run the app in Shiny showcase mode for additional information.

When leveraging these icons in your own apps, the `statIcon` helper function makes accessing the png resource files in `apputils` easier.

```{r icons2}
statIcon("mean")
statIcon("mean", "black")
```

Generating a value box is as easy as the following. Note the key difference is in how `icon` is called. In addition to `valueBox` and `infoBox` from the `shinydashboard` package being overridden by `apputils`, so is `icon` from the `shiny` package. With `apputils::icon`, the `name` argument can be a list with a `src` entry, e.g., `name = list(src = statIcon("mean"))`. This is combined with passing `lib = "local"`. As mentioned, info boxes are also available with custom image file icons.

```{r icons3, eval=FALSE}
valueBox(100, "Mean", icon(list(src = statIcon("mean")), lib = "local"))
infoBox(100, "Mean", icon(list(src = statIcon("mean")), lib = "local"))
```

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="statbox.png"></p>

With loss of some degree of control over content, there are wrapper functions around `valueBox` and `infoBox` for more specific use cases.
See the help documentation for `stat_boxes` and `stat_boxes_group`.

There are a number of other features in `apputils`. Additional sections will be added to this vignette later.
